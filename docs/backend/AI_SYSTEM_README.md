## üß† AI Decision-Making Architecture

### Core Decision Flow

```javascript
calculateBotChoice(bot) ‚Üí 
  analyzeBotPersonality() ‚Üí 
    determineGamePhase() ‚Üí 
      applyStrategy() ‚Üí 
        validateChoice() ‚Üí 
          return optimalNumber
```

### Game Phase Recognition

#### **Early Game Strategy** (Rounds 1-2 or 4+ players)
- **Focus**: Survival and information gathering
- **Approach**: Conservative number selection
- **Rule Considerations**: Basic duplicate avoidance when active

#### **Mid Game Strategy** (3 players remaining)
- **Focus**: Rule mastery and positioning
- **Approach**: Sophisticated duplicate avoidance and perfect target attempts
- **Rule Considerations**: Full duplicate penalty awareness, calculated perfect target risks

#### **End Game Strategy** (2 players remaining)
- **Focus**: Psychological warfare and rule exploitation
- **Approach**: Zero-hundred gambit mastery, pure calculation vs. mind games
- **Rule Considerations**: All rules active, opponent behavior prediction

## üìä Advanced AI Features

### Historical Analysis Engine

The AI system maintains and analyzes comprehensive game history:

```javascript
analyzeRoundHistory() {
  // Tracks last 3 rounds for pattern recognition
  // Identifies commonly chosen numbers for avoidance
  // Calculates average targets for prediction
  // Builds choice frequency maps
}
```

**Data Points Analyzed:**
- Recent target trends and averages
- Commonly chosen numbers by all players
- Round-by-round choice patterns
- Successful vs. unsuccessful strategies

### Predictive Target Calculation

#### **Multi-Player Prediction**
```javascript
predictTargetForRemainingPlayers() {
  // Analyzes player count impact on target ranges
  // Uses historical data for trend analysis
  // Accounts for rule-based behavior changes
  // Provides confidence-weighted predictions
}
```

#### **Two-Player Endgame Prediction**
```javascript
predictTargetForTwoPlayers() {
  // Specialized algorithm for final confrontation
  // Considers psychological factors
  // Balances mathematical vs. gambit strategies
  // Adapts to opponent's historical patterns
}
```

### Rule-Aware Decision Making

#### **Rule 1: Duplicate Number Penalty**
**Activation**: After 1st player elimination
**AI Response**:
- Identifies commonly chosen numbers from history
- Avoids round numbers (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc.)
- Uses prime numbers and specific values (23, 37, 41, 67)
- Implements smart retry logic when initial choice conflicts

**Algorithm**:
```javascript
if (duplicateRuleActive) {
  avoidNumbers = getCommonNumbers() + getRoundNumbers();
  while (avoidNumbers.includes(choice) && attempts < 10) {
    choice = recalculateWithVariation();
  }
}
```

#### **Rule 2: Perfect Target Bonus**
**Activation**: After 2nd player elimination
**AI Response**:
- High-calculation bots attempt perfect targets more frequently
- Risk assessment based on personality type
- Strategic decision between safe play vs. devastating perfect shots
- Considers opponent elimination potential

**Decision Matrix**:
- **Queens**: 30% attempt rate (balanced risk/reward)
- **Aces**: 40% attempt rate (mathematical confidence)
- **Kings**: 20% attempt rate (prefer direct aggression)
- **Jacks**: 15% attempt rate (too unpredictable for precision)

#### **Rule 3: Zero-Hundred Gambit**
**Activation**: After 3rd player elimination (2 players left)
**AI Response**:
- Personality-driven gambit decisions
- Opponent behavior analysis
- Strategic timing of gambit attempts
- Psychological counter-strategies

**Gambit Probabilities**:
- **Kings**: 40% chance to choose 0 (aggressive initiation)
- **Aces**: 30% chance to choose 100 (calculated counter)
- **Jacks**: 50% chance for either 0 or 100 (chaos factor)
- **Queens**: Analyze and respond based on opponent type

## üéØ Strategic Algorithms

### Early Game Algorithm

```javascript
earlyGameStrategy(bot, personality, activeRules) {
  if (firstRound) {
    baseChoice = personalityBasedStartingRange();
    return applyPersonalityVariation(baseChoice);
  }
  
  predictedTarget = analyzeHistoricalTargets();
  
  if (duplicateRuleActive) {
    return avoidCommonNumbersStrategy(predictedTarget);
  }
  
  return targetAdjustmentStrategy(predictedTarget, personality);
}
```

### Mid Game Algorithm

```javascript
midGameStrategy(bot, personality, activeRules) {
  predictedTarget = calculateExpectedTarget();
  
  if (perfectTargetRuleActive && shouldAttemptPerfect()) {
    return Math.round(predictedTarget);
  }
  
  if (duplicateRuleActive) {
    return sophisticatedDuplicateAvoidance(predictedTarget);
  }
  
  return standardMidGameAdjustment(predictedTarget, personality);
}
```

### End Game Algorithm

```javascript
endGameStrategy(bot, personality, activeRules) {
  if (zeroHundredRuleActive) {
    gambitDecision = analyzeGambitOpportunity(opponent, personality);
    if (gambitDecision) return gambitDecision;
  }
  
  if (perfectTargetRuleActive && highCalculationConfidence()) {
    return attemptPerfectTarget();
  }
  
  return mathematicalEndgameStrategy();
}
```

## üîç Number Avoidance Strategies

### Common Number Detection

The AI identifies and avoids predictable choices:

**Round Numbers**: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
**Historical Duplicates**: Numbers chosen by multiple players in recent rounds
**Personality Patterns**: Numbers that match bot's own historical preferences

### Smart Variation Techniques

```javascript
// Avoid obvious numbers while staying competitive
generateSafeChoice(baseTarget) {
  candidates = [];
  for (i = baseTarget-10; i <= baseTarget+10; i++) {
    if (!isAvoidableNumber(i)) {
      candidates.push(i);
    }
  }
  return selectFromCandidates(candidates, personality);
}
```

## üé≤ Randomization and Unpredictability

### Controlled Randomness

The AI uses sophisticated randomization to avoid predictable patterns:

- **Personality-Based Variance**: Each bot type has different randomization ranges
- **Historical Anti-Patterns**: Deliberately break from previous round choices
- **Strategic Noise**: Add calculated unpredictability to optimal choices

### Timing Variation

```javascript
// Staggered decision timing (3-15 seconds)
delay = Math.random() * 12000 + 3000;
setTimeout(() => makeDecision(), delay);
```

This prevents all bots from making simultaneous choices and adds realistic human-like timing.

## üìà Performance Metrics

### AI Effectiveness Targets

- **Survival Rate**: 60-75% reach mid-game (3 players)
- **Perfect Target Success**: 25-35% when attempted
- **Duplicate Avoidance**: 85-95% success rate when rule active
- **Gambit Success**: 40-60% in endgame scenarios

### Difficulty Scaling

The AI difficulty naturally scales with game progression:

1. **Early Game**: Moderate challenge, focuses on teaching basic strategies
2. **Mid Game**: Increased sophistication, rule mastery demonstration
3. **End Game**: Maximum challenge, psychological warfare and perfect play

## üîß Configuration and Tuning

### Personality Adjustment Parameters

```javascript
// Easily tunable personality traits
const PERSONALITY_CONFIG = {
  aggressive: { riskTolerance: 0.8, calculationFocus: 0.6 },
  balanced: { riskTolerance: 0.5, calculationFocus: 0.8 },
  unpredictable: { riskTolerance: 0.7, calculationFocus: 0.4 },
  mathematical: { riskTolerance: 0.3, calculationFocus: 0.9 }
};
```

### Rule Response Tuning

```javascript
// Adjustable response rates to different rules
const RULE_RESPONSE_RATES = {
  perfectTargetAttempt: {
    queens: 0.3, aces: 0.4, kings: 0.2, jacks: 0.15
  },
  zeroHundredGambit: {
