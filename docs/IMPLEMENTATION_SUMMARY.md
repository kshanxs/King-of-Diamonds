## 🎮 Game Mechanics Implementation

### Core Gameplay
1. **Number Selection**: Players choose 0-100 each round
2. **Target Calculation**: Average × 0.8 determines target
3. **Winner Detection**: Closest to target wins
4. **Scoring System**: Winner unchanged, others lose 1 point
5. **Elimination**: -10 points eliminates player
6. **Victory**: Last player standing wins

### Progressive Rules System
1. **Always Active**: Timeout penalty (-2 points)
2. **After 1 Elimination**: Duplicate number penalty (-1 point)
3. **After 2 Eliminations**: Exact target bonus/penalty system
4. **After 3 Eliminations**: Zero-hundred gambit special rule

### AI Bot System
- **16 Named Bots**: Playing card themed (Kings, Queens, Jacks, Aces)
- **4 Personality Types**: Aggressive, Balanced, Unpredictable, Mathematical
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Context-aware number selection
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Responds to game state and active rules
