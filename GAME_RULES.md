# 👑 King of Diamonds - Complete Game Rules & Strategy Guide 💎

## 🎯 Game Overview

King of Diamonds is a psychological strategy game inspired by Alice in Borderland where 5 players compete to be the last survivor through mathematical precision and strategic thinking. Each round, players choose numbers and navigate evolving rules that activate as opponents are eliminated.

## 🎮 Basic Gameplay

### 🏆 Objective
**Be the last player standing** by avoiding elimination while outlasting your opponents.

### ⚙️ Game Setup
- **👥 Players**: 5 total (human players + AI bots)
- **⭐ Starting Points**: All players begin with 0 points
- **💀 Elimination Threshold**: Reach -10 points and you're eliminated
- **🏅 Victory Condition**: Last remaining player wins

### 🔄 Round Structure
1. **⏰ Time Limit**: 60 seconds to choose your number
2. **🔢 Number Range**: Choose any integer from 0 to 100
3. **🎯 Target Calculation**: Target = (Average of all chosen numbers) × 0.8
4. **🏆 Winner Determination**: Player closest to the target wins the round
5. **📊 Point Distribution**:
   - **🥇 Winner**: No point change (stays at current score)
   - **🥈 All Others**: Lose 1 point
   - **⏰ Timeout Penalty**: Lose 2 points if no number submitted

### Example Round Walkthrough

```
Round Example:
Players choose: [25, 40, 60, 75, 100]
Step 1: Calculate average = (25+40+60+75+100) ÷ 5 = 60
Step 2: Calculate target = 60 × 0.8 = 48
Step 3: Find closest to 48:
  - 25 is 23 away from 48
  - 40 is 8 away from 48  ← WINNER
  - 60 is 12 away from 48
  - 75 is 27 away from 48
  - 100 is 52 away from 48
Result: Player who chose 40 wins, others lose 1 point
```

## 📏 Progressive Rules System

The game's complexity increases as players are eliminated, activating powerful new rules that change optimal strategy.

### ⚠️ Always Active: Timeout Penalty
- **🕐 When**: Every round
- **💥 Effect**: Players who don't submit a number lose 2 points instead of 1
- **💡 Strategy**: Always submit something, even a random number is better than timing out

### 🚨 Rule 1: Duplicate Number Penalty
**🔓 Activates after 1st player elimination**

- **⚡ Trigger**: Multiple players choose the same number
- **💥 Effect**: ALL players who chose the duplicate number lose 1 additional point
- **📊 Total Penalty**: Duplicating players lose 2 points (1 for not winning + 1 duplicate penalty)
- **🏆 Winner Exception**: If duplicate number wins, those players still get the duplicate penalty

**Example:**
```
Players choose: [30, 45, 45, 60, 80]
Target: 49.6
Winner: Player with 45 (closest to target)
Penalty: Both players who chose 45 lose 1 extra point for duplicating
Result: Winner loses 1 point, other duplicator loses 2 points, others lose 1 point
```

**Strategic Implications:**
- Avoid "obvious" numbers (multiples of 10, round numbers)
- Think about what others might choose
- Use reverse psychology (sometimes obvious numbers become safe)

### 💯 Rule 2: Perfect Target Bonus
**🔓 Activates after 2nd player elimination**

- **⚡ Trigger**: A player chooses the exact target number (rounded to nearest integer)
- **💥 Effect**: All OTHER players lose 2 points instead of 1
- **🎯 Perfect Player**: Gets 0 point change (normal winner treatment)

**Example:**
```
Players choose: [20, 35, 50, 80]
Average: 46.25, Target: 37 (46.25 × 0.8 = 37)
If someone chose exactly 37: They win, others lose 2 points each
```

**Strategic Implications:**
- With fewer players, target calculation becomes more predictable
- High risk, high reward - calculating the perfect number can devastate opponents
- Consider what average others might aim for

### 💀 Rule 3: Zero-Hundred Gambit
**🔓 Activates after 3rd player elimination (final 2 players)**

- **⚡ Trigger**: One player chooses 0
- **🎲 Special Rule**: The other player can win by choosing 100, regardless of normal target calculation
- **📊 Normal Rule**: If neither chooses 0, or if the 0-chooser's opponent doesn't choose 100, normal closest-to-target rules apply

**Strategic Scenarios:**
```
Scenario A - Gambit Successful:
Player 1: 0, Player 2: 100
Result: Player 2 wins (100 beats 0 in the gambit)

Scenario B - Gambit Countered:
Player 1: 0, Player 2: 50
Calculate normally: Average = 25, Target = 20
Result: Player 1 wins (0 is closer to 20 than 50)

Scenario C - No Gambit:
Player 1: 30, Player 2: 70
Calculate normally: Average = 50, Target = 40
Result: Player 1 wins (30 is closer to 40 than 70)
```

**Strategic Implications:**
- Pure psychological warfare - do you trust your opponent?
- Choosing 0 can be a power play or a trap
- Choosing 100 is only beneficial if opponent chooses 0

## 🧠 Advanced Strategy Guide

### Early Game Strategy (5 Players)
**Goal: Survive while gathering information**

**Recommended Range: 30-55**
- Most players aim for "middle" numbers
- 0.8 multiplier means target will be lower than average
- Avoid extremes (0-20, 80-100) unless you have specific reads

**Key Tactics:**
- **Conservative Play**: Choose numbers that are likely close to 40-50
- **Pattern Recognition**: Watch for player tendencies
- **Avoidance**: Stay away from "obvious" numbers others might pick

### Mid Game Strategy (3-4 Players)
**Goal: Adapt to active rules while positioning for endgame**

**Rule 1 Active (Duplicate Penalty):**
- **Anti-Meta**: Avoid round numbers (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
- **Specific Numbers**: Use numbers like 23, 37, 41, 67
- **Reverse Psychology**: Sometimes "obvious" becomes safe when everyone avoids it

**Rule 2 Active (Perfect Target):**
- **Calculate Precisely**: With fewer players, you can better predict the average
- **Risk Assessment**: Going for perfect target is high-risk, high-reward
- **Safe Alternative**: Choose numbers slightly off from calculated target

### End Game Strategy (2 Players)
**Goal: Master the zero-hundred gambit while managing all active rules**

**All Rules Active:**
- Duplicate penalty, perfect target, and zero-hundred gambit
- Pure psychological warfare between two opponents
- Every decision is critical

**Zero-Hundred Decision Matrix:**
- **Choose 0 if**: You believe opponent will choose 100 (you lose) or you want to force their hand
- **Choose 100 if**: You believe opponent will choose 0 (you win) 
- **Choose neither if**: You want to play mathematical game and avoid the gambit

**Psychological Factors:**
- **Mind Games**: Your choice influences opponent's next-round thinking
- **Pattern Breaking**: Don't be predictable across rounds
- **Reverse Psychology**: Sometimes the obvious play is correct

## 🎯 Mathematical Analysis

### Target Calculation Deep Dive

The 0.8 multiplier creates interesting mathematical properties:

**With 5 players choosing optimally around 50:**
- Average ≈ 50
- Target ≈ 40
- Optimal choice: Around 40

**But if everyone chooses 40:**
- Average = 40
- Target = 32
- New optimal: Around 32

**This creates convergence to approximately 0:**
- Each iteration: new_target = old_target × 0.8
- Eventually converges to very low numbers
- **Key Insight**: Don't overthink the convergence; other players won't either

### Probability Analysis

**Early Game Number Distribution:**
- Most players choose 20-60
- Target typically lands 16-48
- Sweet spot: 25-45

**Duplicate Probability:**
- With 100 possible numbers and 5 players
- Round numbers (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) have higher collision probability
- Prime numbers (23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47) have lower collision probability
